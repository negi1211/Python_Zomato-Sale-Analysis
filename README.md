Zomato Sales Analysis Overview: This project analyzes Zomato's restaurant dataset to uncover insights into restaurant ratings, cuisine preferences, price range impacts, and service features. The analysis highlights critical factors influencing customer satisfaction and business success, providing data-driven recommendations for strategic improvements.

Objective: To understand the distribution of ratings, cuisines, and price ranges. To identify factors driving customer satisfaction, including service features and delivery availability. To provide actionable recommendations for business optimization and customer satisfaction enhancement. Key Features of the Analysis Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values in cuisines, address, and zipcode. Removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Evaluated top-rated and low-rated restaurants. Investigated the relationship between price range and ratings. Analyzed the popularity of cuisines and service features. Feature Engineering:

Extracted and analyzed key service features like Wi-Fi, Alcohol, Outdoor Seating, etc. Visualizations:

Created histograms, box plots, and bar charts to explore trends in ratings, cuisines, and prices. Key Insights Ratings:

Most ratings fall between 3 and 4, with outliers indicating extremely high or low-rated restaurants. Restaurants offering delivery services tend to have higher ratings. Cuisines:

North Indian and Fast Food are the most popular cuisines, followed by Chinese. A larger variety of cuisines does not strongly correlate with higher ratings. Price Range:

Majority of restaurants fall in the lowest price range, with higher-priced restaurants showing slightly better ratings. Service Features:
